### What's needed
- write the app in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- integrate callbacks with use of custom [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- full test coverage with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- integrate OpenStreeMap api
- code quality checking with ESLint
- style with styled-components

### Nice to have
- end to end CI/CD with Docker, CircleCI and Digital Ocean
- PWA (progressive web app) setup for offline functionality
